Phishing scams related to free electronics are becoming increasingly common. Scammers create fake websites that mimic official government portals. Their goal is to trick users into entering sensitive personal information like Aadhar numbers, bank details, or addresses. Telltale signs of these scams include a sense of urgency, grammatical errors in the text, and website URLs that are not from the official 'gov.in' domain. Users should always verify schemes on official websites before providing any details. These campaigns are designed to harvest data for identity theft or financial fraud.
