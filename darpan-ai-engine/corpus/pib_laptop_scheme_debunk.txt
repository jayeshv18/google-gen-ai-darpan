Claim: A WhatsApp message is viral with a link, claiming the Government of India is providing free laptops to students.
PIB Fact Check Finding: This claim is FAKE. No such scheme has been announced by the Government of India. The link provided is a scam and is used for phishing. Citizens are advised not to click on such links or share their personal information. The official source for government schemes is the national portal of India, india.gov.in. Any announcement would be made through official press releases.
